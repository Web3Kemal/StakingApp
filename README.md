Hello,this is a staking dApp that has been forked by a thirdweb guide. I've adapted the guide for 3 different projects. Thirdweb's staking smart contract is built to work only with two different tokens for staking and rewards. This system applies for the staaking dapp in this repo, I've recently built a version that has lock functionalities and uses the same token as reward and stake. The latter version is rightnow still private because it is somewhat more complicated, I can share it upon request.
